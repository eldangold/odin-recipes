    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Honey chicken is a classic Australian-Chinese dish. Deep-fried battered
      chicken tossed through a sweet and savoury sauce made with honey and soy
      sauce.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 chicken breasts (about 600g), trimmed and cut into 2-3cm cubes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
      <li>40g piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
      <li>6 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>5 tbsp honey</li>
      <li>Â½-1 lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sunflower, vegetable, rice bran or rapeseed oil</li>
      <li>cooked rice and steamed broccoli, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>
        Tip the chicken into a bowl, sprinkle over the flour and some seasoning
        and toss until the chicken is evenly coated.
      </p>
      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>
        Combine the ginger, garlic, soy, honey and half the lemon juice in a
        bowl. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok over a high heat and fry
        the chicken for 3-4 mins until lightly golden. Tip in the honey sauce
        and stir-fry for 10 mins, or until the chicken is cooked through and the
        sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon. Taste for
        seasoning and squeeze over the remaining lemon juice, if needed, then
        serve with rice and steamed broccoli, if you like.
